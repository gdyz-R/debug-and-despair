# My Embedded Debug Logbook


This is a collection of notes, debugging logs, and painful lessons learned while developing an ESP32-based smart health monitoring system with PlatformIO and ESP-IDF. Topics include audio (ES8311), MQTT integration, AI APIs, ESP-NOW, and more.

These notes are written for:
- Independent developers
- Students working on embedded projects
- Anyone who has yelled at their board at 2AM

Most files are in Markdown, organized by topic. Enjoy — and may your bugs be shallow.
